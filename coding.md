< Own Your Expertise / Coding >
=================================

Agenda is here: <http://bit.ly/WSC2014>

One hour is not a lot of time, and most likely we won't have time to actually contribute to a project today. But we can at least start the process, by finding a project that both interests you and is beginner-friendly, then setting it up on your local machine.

Step 1: Find an Open Source Project to Contribute to (15 min)
---------------------------------------------------------------

1. Find 1-3 potential projects to contribute to

2. Share what you found on the WSC2014 Etherpad: <https://pad.riseup.net/p/WSC2014Coding>

Tips for brainstorming potential projects:
- What projects do you use and would personally benefit from?
- Is there an issue you're passionate about?
- Contributions don't have to be *just* code. Many open source projects are sorely needing better documentation (think of all the libraries you've used that could benefit from more/clearer examples)

What to look for:
- good documentation on how to contribute, including how to setup and run
- good test coverage (so you know you don’t break shit)
- a community (google group, IRC, forum etc)
- labelled issues

Feeling Overwhelmed? Try these:
- Quill uses open software and open content, and have [clearly labled issues](https://github.com/empirical-org/Empirical-Core/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Level%3A+Starter%22) (look for "Level: Starter" and "1 - Ready")
- Try a [bite sized bug](http://openhatch.org/search/?q=&toughness=bitesize) on Open Hatch

Step 2: Check-in & Feedback (5 min)
---------------------------------------------------
Let's spend a few minutes to share some of the projects with each other: 
- what types of projects did you try to find?
- how did you decide on a project?

Step 3: Find 1-2 issues that you could attempt (15 min)
---------------------------------------------------

Step 4: Setup the project, start on the issue if time (35 min)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Fork the project, clone it to your laptop, and then set up the project. This will most likely take up some time.

If you finish setting up your project environment, go ahead and start working on your open source contribution!

Step 5: Check-in & Feedback (5 min)
-----------------------
- How did finding issues & project setup go?
- Let's also take this time to share what we did with each other: https://pad.riseup.net/p/WSC2014

What to do after today?
-----------------------
- Work on the issue, then submit a pull request. *There may be some back and forth - don't get discouraged!*
- Seek out a mentor if you need help submitting a pull request (a mailing list, a meetup office hours, us!)
- Make some public projects for yourself
- Blog/tweet about it!
- Go to open source socials 
  - know of an upcoming event? Share it here: <https://pad.riseup.net/p/WSC2014Coding>
